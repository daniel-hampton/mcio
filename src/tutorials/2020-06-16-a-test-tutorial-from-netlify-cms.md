# Hello World

In this example article I am writing it from with the Netlify CMS interface. It is really only marginally better as far as writing pretty text compared to writing the markdown in VS Code. Where it may shine however is helping integrate a non-technical person into the static site's continuous deployment strategy and helping authenticate the content authors.

## Dangerous

I'm not 100% sure what will happen when creating a new article. On publish I think it will push to the git repo.

### Exciting

What else can we do?

```python
# This is a comment for a code block in python
print('Hello World')
def my_function(x):
  print(2*x)
  return

print('Not so hard to write')
```
